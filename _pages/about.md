I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a strong interest in advancing health care through innovative technology. With undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Business Administration, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective to complex problems at the intersection of computing, data, and human health.

My research experience spans from studying neuroscience and brain injury to upcoming work focused on cardiac arrhythmias. These experiences have reinforced my belief in the potential of computational tools, particularly machine learning and data-driven systems, to improve diagnostics, treatment, and overall patient outcomes.

I am especially motivated by opportunities that combine rigorous technical work with real-world application in health care and medicine. Over the course of my PhD, I aim to contribute to research that not only advances the field of computer science but also delivers meaningful impact for clinicians and patients alike.

I'm always open to connecting with others working at the intersection of technology and health, and welcome opportunities for collaboration or discussion in this space.
